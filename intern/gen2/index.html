                                Hi I'm Sophie and I’m currently a rising senior in Toronto. 
                                I had an amazing time working with EMGirls’s intern team and 
                                meeting so many talented individuals. As a student heading towards 
                                business management and law, I really resonate with EMGirls’s message. 
                                Getting the opportunity to lead and organize EMMarketing was an 
                                amazing experience.
