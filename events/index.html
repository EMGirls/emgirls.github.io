                EMGirls is a youth-led non-profit organization that aims to empower women in fields 
                where there are evident gender gaps, such as with entrepreneurship. We aim to challenge 
                girls to step outside their comfort zones and discover their interests and motives to 
                create a change!

                EMGirls’ Entrepreneurial Competition is our annual flagship event which was hosted in August 2020 
                and January 2021. We initiated this event to help transform girls’ nascent business ideas into 
                actual businesses and/or develop their existing businesses further. Over 480+ female youth from 
                49 countries participated in this competition.

                The 2P Program is a series of short lessons that expose girls to the world of entrepreneurship. 
                Through this program, we hope to inspire and encourage girls to reach their full potential, all 
                while providing opportunities for girls to develop their confidence, public speaking skills, and 
                entrepreneurial knowledge.
