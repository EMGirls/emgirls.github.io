                EMGirls aims to bridge the gender gap in the 
                entrepreneurship field and acts as a catalyst 
                for girls to hone their confidence, resilience, 
                and critical thinking.

            <p class ="aboutUsText">
                During the summer of 2019, Candice, 
                one of the co-founders of EMGirls, 
                had the opportunity to go to an 
                entrepreneurial summer camp. She was 
                very excited about it at first since 
                she has always been interested in business. 
                However, when she entered the camp, she was 
                surprised to find out that there were only 
                7 girls out of 60 participants in the camp!
                <br><br>
                Women, despite being about half the labor 
                force, only own 36 percent of companies in 
                the United States. Just 19 percent of top 
                executives are women, which means out of 10 
                executives, only two are female. Research 
                shows that women around the world are less 
                likely to consider entrepreneurship as a career path.
                <br><br>
                We recognize this huge gender disparity in 
                the business field, especially the entrepreneurship 
                area. And we strive to change that at EMGirls! Our 
                goal is to empower girls and make entrepreneurial 
                resources more accessible.

                <b>April 3rd, 2020 || EMGirls is established</b><br>
                EMGirls was established in April 2020 during the 
                COVID-19 pandemic, when Emily Nguyen and Candice 
                Huang had an aspiration to empower girls and bridge 
                the gender gap in the #entrepreneurship field. The 
                name “EMGirls”, coined by the co-founder and co-director 
                Candice Huang was first legally used after issuing a 
                certificate of incorporation approved by the Innovation, 
                Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) on April 
                3rd, 2020. Later on, it was first public on EMGirls first 
                instagram post on April 18th, marking the new beginning of 
                a youth-led organization.
